"""
model.py — CP-SAT model builder.
Creates all decision variables, encodes all 21 hard constraints (HC) and
9 soft penalty terms (SC), then returns the model and variable dictionaries.

Takes a DataBundle (see data.py) instead of importing module-level globals, so the same
builder works against the hardcoded default dataset or a dashboard/DB-driven one.
