# --- replan() golden behavior ---
#
# Solver choice in these tests is deliberate. The structural guarantees (nothing lands in a blocked
# slot, inputs aren't mutated, unplaceable sessions are named) hold for ANY solver, so those tests
# use `solver="greedy"` and run instantly. Only the quality claim -- "a rained-out session is
# rescheduled instead of dropped" -- needs a real solve, so it shares ONE module-scoped CP-SAT
# replan rather than paying for it per test. CP-SAT needs >=10s here: at 5s it times out and the
# greedy fallback takes over (hard=22). The budget was widened 30s -> 120s when hard constraint 21
# (division continuous-teaching cap, CLAUDE.md §4) landed: the extra per-division/day sliding-window
# constraints across all 5 days made the whole-week resolve model harder to satisfy within the old
# 30s margin, so CP-SAT was timing out and falling back to greedy (which doesn't enforce rule 21).
# In isolation 60s alone reliably reached hard=0, but inside the full test_disruption.py run (CPU
# contention from the earlier CP-SAT baseline fixture and other tests in the same session) 60s
# proved marginal and flaked to hard=0 in isolation vs hard=28 in-suite -- CP-SAT's parallel search
# is not wall-clock-deterministic near the solving frontier. 120s gave comfortable, repeatable
# margin (hard=0 both standalone and inside the full test_disruption.py run) -- see design.md §17.
