"""Background job runner for `POST /api/runs` (design.md §5.3, CLAUDE.md §11).

`run_generation` is handed to Starlette's `BackgroundTasks`, which executes it in a threadpool
*after* the request has already returned its response — so it cannot reuse the request's DB
session (that session is closed by then) and opens its own. It must never raise: a solver
exception is caught and recorded on the run row (`status="failed"`, `error=...`) so the SPA can
show it, rather than being lost to a background-thread traceback that nothing observes.
