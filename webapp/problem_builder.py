"""DB rows -> `ProblemInstance` snapshot (design.md §4.2, CLAUDE.md "Platform data flow").

`build_problem_dict` assembles exactly the JSON shape `timetable.io_json.problem_from_dict`
parses (see `data/reference/djsce_cse_ds_sy_sem4.json` for a concrete instance of that shape).
`readiness` wraps that with `problem.validate()` so routers can surface a plain-English readiness
banner without ever raising on a partially-populated DB.

Global entities (faculty, rooms, slot template) are shared across the whole institution and are
therefore always emitted in full; only `courses` and `divisions` are filtered by `branch_ids`
(CLAUDE.md §3 — "Solves always cover the whole institution... branch filtering is a view-only
concern"). This module only reads; it never writes (CLAUDE.md §15 — no files/rows created by code
outside `platform.db` / `uploads/`).
