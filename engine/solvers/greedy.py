"""Deterministic constructive heuristic — a sub-second feasible-ish seed for the pipeline.

Processes the most constrained sessions first (breaks, then lab batch-pairs, then cross-division
open-elective sync groups, then remaining theory/tutorial), scanning slots in a fixed day/period
order and taking the first structurally-valid placement. Sessions with no remaining feasible slot
are left unassigned rather than raising — `scoring.py` penalizes unassigned sessions as a hard
violation, so downstream stages (GA/CP-SAT) can still improve on a partial seed.
