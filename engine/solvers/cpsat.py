"""CP-SAT solver -- Danish's approach.

Uses `ortools.sat.python.cp_model`. Shares the same candidate-pruning and hard-constraint set as
the MIP solver (via `timetable.solvers.candidates`) so the two are judged on equal footing, but
adds a genuinely richer objective CP-SAT can express natively that MIP's linear-sum formulation
cannot: per-(division, day) gap-minimization via reified "occupied at period p" booleans and
AddMaxEquality-based before/after indicators. This -- alongside AddNoOverlap-style reasoning being
unnecessary here since occupancy is already tracked per slot -- is the concrete mechanism behind
CP-SAT's quality edge in the team's own benchmark (best soft-cost, longest runtime).

The objective is built as four named categories (`rooms`, `labs`, `students`, `faculty`) instead
of one flat sum. `solve()` still minimizes their combined total (unchanged end-to-end behavior for
every existing caller), but `solve_pareto_point()` exposes the categories individually so a
research-track epsilon-constraint sweep (design.md Sec 15.3) can bound some of them and optimize
another, reusing this exact model -- see `research/pareto_sweep.py`.
