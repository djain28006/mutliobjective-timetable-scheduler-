"""Mixed Integer Programming solver — Zane's approach.

Uses OR-Tools' `pywraplp` linear-solver wrapper (CBC backend) rather than a second dependency
like PuLP. Boolean variables x[req, start_slot, room] are pruned to structurally-valid combos
before creation (faculty availability, room type/capacity, break-slot exclusion, fixed protected
slots) to keep the model tractable. Batch-pair "different room" (hard constraint 16) is enforced
by construction: each half of a lab pair only gets candidate rooms from a disjoint half of the
lab pool, so the two halves can never choose the same physical lab; "same slot" is enforced by an
explicit linear equality between the two halves' slot-indicator sums. Gap-minimization and the
lab-distribution-pattern soft constraint are NOT linearized in this MVP objective (documented
limitation vs CP-SAT, which expresses them natively via NoOverlap + reified booleans).
