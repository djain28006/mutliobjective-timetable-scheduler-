"""Genetic Algorithm solver -- Abhish's GA+ML architecture (hand-rolled, no DEAP).

Design follows the team's own architecture docs (references/GA_ML_Timetable_Optimization_*.pdf):
  - Chromosome: one fixed-position gene per SessionRequirement (from expand_requirements), so
    crossover positions have stable meaning across the whole population.
  - Initialization: staged construction (assign_break_slots -> allocate_lab_blocks ->
    assign_theory_sessions -> repair_schedule), matching the doc's Block 3. Implemented as a
    randomized variant of the greedy constructor for population diversity.
  - Selection: tournament (k=3). Crossover: division-wise (primary) + uniform gene crossover
    (secondary/fallback). Mutation: reassign-gene, swap-slots, shift-lab-block.
  - Fitness: 10000*hard + 100*normalized_soft + 40*difficulty + 60*fatigue + 30*infra, per the
    doc's weights (hard/soft terms come from the shared scoring.py so GA stays comparable to
    MIP/CP-SAT; soft_cost is normalized by requirement count so the ML terms -- on a clean [0,1]
    scale -- stay meaningfully influential rather than drowned out by soft_cost's larger raw
    magnitude).

DEAP was deliberately not used: its generic `creator`/`toolbox` machinery is built around
position/order-based crossover operators that don't understand scheduling semantics (room-type
validity, batch pairing, faculty eligibility) -- using it would still require hand-writing custom
repair/crossover/mutation operators, so it mainly adds an extra dependency and global mutable
state without saving real code, at the cost of transparency in a codebase meant to explain how
each of the three solvers works.
