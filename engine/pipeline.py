"""Orchestration: the genuine hybrid pipeline plus the cold ensemble baseline.

`run_pipeline` -- COOPERATIVE 4-stage hybrid (the recommended production path). All four
algorithms take part and each one hands its work to the next; they are not run independently and
compared. The chain:

    1. Greedy      builds a fast feasible seed (sub-second).
    2. MIP         warm-started from the greedy seed (SetHint); solves the exact 0/1 model,
                   nailing the hard constraints + the linearizable soft terms.
    3. GA          initial population seeded from BOTH the greedy seed AND the MIP solution;
                   explores the soft-constraint / ML-fitness space MIP cannot express, producing
                   a diverse improved candidate.
    4. CP-SAT      warm-started (AddHint) from the best candidate so far; does the final polish
                   using its richer objective (native gap-minimization etc.).

Every stage passes its solution forward as a warm start, so stage N literally continues from
stage N-1's work. `better()` (lexicographic on (hard_violations, soft_cost) from scoring.py) is a
safety net that keeps the running best monotonic -- if any stage's solver returns something worse
(e.g. a timeout), the pipeline carries the earlier, better solution forward as the next stage's
warm start rather than losing it. The result records each stage so you can see the quality climb.

`run_ensemble` -- the CONTRAST baseline: runs Greedy, MIP, GA independently from a cold start (no
cross-seeding), then picks the best. CP-SAT is deliberately excluded from this cold comparison
(owner decision, 2026-07-21) -- it is the platform's polish/default solver, not one of the cold
baselines here. Useful to show how much the hybrid handoff actually buys over "just run the fast
baselines and compare".
