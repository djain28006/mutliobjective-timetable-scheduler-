"""Disruption engine (design.md §7) — the "rain day / holiday" re-plan flow.

Two modes, selected by `replan(..., mode=...)`:

**`mode="resolve"` (the DEFAULT).** Block the disrupted slots, exempt that day from the day-shaped
hard rules, and **re-solve the whole week from scratch**, warm-started from the baseline. A
rained-out lab is therefore rescheduled somewhere else in the week rather than discarded. This gives
up the "unaffected days are byte-identical" guarantee in exchange for "nothing is silently lost" —
the owner's explicit call, because dropping a session is worse than reshuffling one. Warm-starting
means most unaffected sessions do land back where they were, but that is emergent, not pinned.
Because the exact solvers force every session to be placed, a genuinely over-constrained window
(e.g. a whole-day holiday, whose load cannot fit into four days under the 6–8h/day caps) falls back
to a greedy best-effort plan and reports `hard_violations` / unplaced sessions honestly.

**`mode="minimal"`.** The original P4 minimal-change patcher, kept for comparison:

When part of a day becomes unusable (sudden rain from 2 pm, a declared holiday), we do NOT
regenerate the whole week — that would move classes students and faculty have already planned
around. Instead we make a **minimal-change** adjustment:

  1. Every session on an UNDISRUPTED day is copied verbatim from the baseline — identical slot AND
     room. Those days are untouched, guaranteed.
  2. On the disrupted day, sessions whose baseline slot is NOT in the blocked window (the surviving
     morning classes, say) keep their exact placement.
  3. Sessions whose baseline slot IS blocked are displaced. We try to relocate each into a free,
     non-blocked slot on the same day (respecting no double-booking, batch-pair sync, subject-
     once-per-day). Any that don't fit are **dropped** for that occurrence — you cannot make up a
     rained-out afternoon by overloading another day past its 6-8h hard cap, so a genuinely lost
     session is reported as dropped rather than silently forced somewhere invalid.

This is built directly (not via the exact MIP/CP-SAT solvers) on purpose: the exact solvers force
*every* session to be placed (`AddExactlyOne`), which makes "some classes are simply cancelled by
the rain" an infeasible model. Direct construction is always feasible, deterministic, and truly
minimal-change. The master run is never mutated — the caller stores this as a dated overlay.

The engine-level `blocked_slot_ids` / `relaxed_days` / `pinned_slots` support added alongside this
module still lets an admin manually re-solve a blocked-window scenario with any solver if they want
a full re-optimization instead of a minimal-change patch.
