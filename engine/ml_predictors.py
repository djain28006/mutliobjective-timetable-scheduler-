"""Predictive quality models feeding GA's fitness function (Abhish's GA+ML architecture).

Per the team's architecture docs, three models predict normalized [0,1] quality indicators that
do NOT construct the timetable themselves -- they only refine fitness scoring:
  difficulty_score  = difficultyModel.predict(subjectFeatures)
  fatigue_index     = fatigueModel.predict(dayFeatures)
  infra_stress_score = infraModel.predict(weekFeatures)

These are heuristic, rule-based stand-ins: no real historical academic-performance dataset
(average marks, failure rates, assessment weightage) exists yet to train actual regressors. Each
model's `predict(features: dict) -> float` interface is deliberately narrow so a trained sklearn
model can be swapped in later without touching the GA loop -- only these classes change.
